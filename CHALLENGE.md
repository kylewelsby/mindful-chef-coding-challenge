# Robot Warehouse Coding Tests

## Background

We have installed a robot in our warehouse and now we need to be able to send it
commands to control it. We need you to implement the control mechanism.

For convenience the robot moves along a grid in the roof of the warehouse and we
have made sure that all of our warehouses are built so that the dimensions of
the grid are 10 by 10. We've also made sure that all our warehouses are aligned
along north-south and east-west axes.

All of the commands to the robot consist of a single capital letter and
different commands are comma seperated.

## Part One

The robot should accept the following commands:

- N move north
- W move west
- E move east
- S move south

### Example command sequences

The command sequence: "N,E,S,W" will move the robot in a full square, returning
it to where it started.

If the robot starts in the south-west corner of the warehouse then the following
commands will move it to the middle of the warehouse.

"N,E,N,E,N,E,N,E"

### Requirements

- Create a way to send a series of commands to the robot
- Make sure that the robot doesn't try to move outside the warehouse
